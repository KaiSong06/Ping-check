This is a webscraper scraping HTML code from the website https://packetstats.com. This website is used to test connection stability to a server, in my case in NY.
To use these programs, you must change the driver variable from "Safari" to your personal browser being used.


This program was created to provide a solution to my problem of not knowing when my connection would be stable enough to play ranked mode on League of Legends as I would 
frequently experience high ping.
